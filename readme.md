### CREATOR: Harrison Darbin
#### NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS: None yet :(
#### VERSION: 0.1.1: "The Possibly Working Update"

Current issues: Clearing out unwanted (non-wiki) links, improving runtime as always.\
What we really need: Hope and a computer powerful enough to run this (aka hope).\
Looking Forward: Once the web files are done, get the first Hscore, then expand to more general application.\
How it works: \
We use this thing called code\
