# v0.2.0
### CREATOR: Harrison Darbin
#### OTHER CONTRIBUTORS: 
 - Karen "[TalkingKittyCat](https://github.com/talkingkittycat)" 
 - Garrett "[GarrettTh](https://github.com/GarrettTh)" Thompson
#### VERSION: 0.2.0: "The Actually Working Update"

### IMPORTANT NOTE
If calculating the HScore, use the HScoreNew algorithm. The old HScore has not been fully tested, and is unknown if it will even finish on larger sets.
### Current issues: 
 - Improving runtime (as always).
### Current efforts: 
 - Finalizing HScore & implementing a second, faster HScore algorithm
 - Beginning to implement a form of PageRank (not yet pushed)
 - Creating a frontend for user interaction with collected data (not yet pushed, low priority)
### What we really need: Hope and a stronger computer.
### Code Format: Condensed, same-line comments.
```
void Example(){ //This is an example function
  int test1, test2 = 0; //testing variables
  if(test2 == 0){ //testing function
    test1 = 2;
    test2++;
  }
  if(test1 == 2) test2++;
  else test1++;
  while(test1 < test2) if(test1 != 10) test1++; //test loop
}
```
